# Health Assured Checkout Kata

This project contains my solution to the Supermarket Checkout Kata.

There are two projects within the C# solution:
 - CheckoutKata
 - CheckoutKata.UnitTest

## CheckoutKata

This project contains the main code and it can be found in the Checkout class.

The PricingRule class are only used to store pricing and the rules of it. It does not contain any methods.

There are also a Interface folder. This is where all Interfaces should be stored.

## CheckoutKata.UnitTest

This project contains all the Unit Tests which can be found in the CheckoutTest test class.

Inside the CheckoutTest class, it contains a constructor where it sets up the Dependency Injection for the Checkout service.
